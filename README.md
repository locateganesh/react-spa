#First, install react project.
You can use terminal or use Visual Studio code. It has inbuild terminal.
In your terminal go to location where you want to work eg. `C:\User\Ganesh\Desktop` (if you want to create react app on desktop).
Type `npx create-react-app`  and space your application name. In my case it's react-spa. (*Note:* Don't use any capital letter in your app name).
Go to app folder `cd react-spa`
then run project my npm start.
You can see default react page with link open your default browser `http://location:3000`
