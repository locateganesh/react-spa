# React SPA

First, install the react project.
You can use the terminal or use Visual Studio Code with its inbuilt terminal.
In your terminal go to the location where you want to work eg. `C:\User\Ganesh\Desktop` (if you want to create react app on desktop).
Type `npx create-react-app`  and space your application name. In my case it's react-spa. (*Note:* Don't use any capital letter in your app name).
Go to app folder `cd react-spa`
then run the project `npm start`.
You can see the default react page with a link opens your default browser. `http://location:3000`

	`npx create-react-app react-spa
	cd my-app
	npm start`
	
After done the project. Build the project for production version using...
	
	`npm run build`
